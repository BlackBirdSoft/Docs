Installing WordPress - Manually
==================


You may find yourself needing to install a previous or newer version of WordPress than what is offered in the 1-click install. In those cases you can manually install WordPress with this guide. If you need to install using the 1-click install method, those directions can be found [here](https://here.com) and we highly recommend you use this great feature!

 1. Login to your CloudSites control panel by going to
    (https://my.gearhost.com). 
 2.  Add a CloudSite
 3. Choose your plan then select *Create Empty CloudSite*
 4. Name your CloudSite
 5. Download the latest version of WordPress by following this [link](https://wordpress.org/download/)
 6. Create your FTP credentials. If you do not have an FTP user setup, you can find instructions for that [here](https://my.gearhost.com)
 7. Using the FTP client of your choice, unzip the downloaded WordPress file and copy the full contents of the folder to your CloudSites root.
 8. Create a MySQL database. Remember those credentials because you will need to connect your WP install to the newly created database. Instructions for creating a database can be found [here](https://my.gearhost.com)
 9. Navigate to your WordPress install page by going to *"yoursite".gear.host/wp-install*
 10. Follow the step by step to connect your database and create log in credentials for your WordPress admin page.
