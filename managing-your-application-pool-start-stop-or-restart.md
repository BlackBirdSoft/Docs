#Managing your application pool.
Sometimes your application pool can start to hang, or simply stops working causing your website to display a certain error. 

This guide will go over starting, stopping, or restarting your application pool.

----------

Login to your [portal.](https://my.gearhost.com/ "hosting portal.")

Select **Cloudsites** and click on the one you wish to manage.

As an example, I'll be choosing the **austin** cloudsite by clicking on the blue text link.

This should take you to the "**Overview** menu tab. Scroll down until you see the **Quick Glance** section. 

From here you will be able to Start, Stop or Recycle your application pool.
