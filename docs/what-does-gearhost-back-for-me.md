#What does GearHost backup for me?

We do not keep backups as part of our regular services for shared environment users. Please retain your own backups of all of your important data. As a courtesy we do allow users access to our internal backups. We will have to check that the backup is available before we are able to commit to the restoration. There are circumstances where our internal backups may not be available. There is a $30 fee for GearHost to restore any data. Do keep in mind that our backups only go back 5 days for any site files, databases, or emails. Please note that if you request a restoration the files will be restored to the latest backup that we have unless you ask otherwise. Our backup program runs between 12am-4am MST. Once a restoration is requested we will restore the files and there will be a charge for it. Any additional or subsequent restorations will also incur a fee. For example, if your email client deleted all of your email from our server and you need it restored, then after the restore the client program deletes it again, you will need to pay for an additional restore. 

To request a restoration please contact our support team by opening a ticket by logging into your account at https://my.gearhost.com and selecting the support menu. Please let us know you accept the $30 fee for the restoration and we can get that started immediately.
