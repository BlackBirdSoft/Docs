# GearHost Backups

### How often are backups performed?
GearHost automatically backs up data for a retention period of 5 days. Each run overwrites any previous backups and most backups run between 12AM-4AM. 
 
### Are restores free?
Our backups are only done as courtesy, but we do recommend manually backing up your own data. If you wish to use our backups to restore anything our fee is $30.00. Any additional or subsequent restorations will also incur a fee. 

### I have a CloudServer, are backups available?
If you have a CloudServer please enable the **Managed Backups** add-on to ensure that all of your data is backed up. The disk space for this add-on has to match the current disk space that's allocated to your CloudServer. You can make changes for CloudServer products by going to your billing [portal](https://customer.gearhost.com/clientarea.php) and following the steps provided [here.](https://gearhost.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200341695-Upgrade-Downgrade-a-CloudServer)

### How do I request a restore?
To request a restore please contact our support team by opening a [support ticket.](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/how-to-open-a-support-ticket) If you have a CloudServer product, please e-mail us directly to support@gearhost.com with your request. When submitting a support ticket, please be sure to state what you want restored and authorizing the $30.00 restore fee. If you need data restored and do not want us to overwrite anything please let us know.
