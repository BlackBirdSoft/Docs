# How to deploy your repo using GitHub
In this guide, we'll show you how to deploy your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository to your CloudSite. If you do not have a GitHub repository, please be sure to check out our previous guide [here](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/github-getting-started).

### I've made changes in my app, what now?
When making changes to your app locally or on GitHub, your CloudSite will automatically load the new changes as it's synchronized to your git repository.

### I've made a mistake, can I revert my changes?
You sure can! If you're using GitHub Desktop Client just go to your **History** menu, browse for your previous commit. Click on the gear icon and select `Revert this commit`. If you're using the command line we recommend checking this [guide](https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git) out.

### How can I change repository after deploying?
Click on the `Reset Password` button on your **Publish** menu. This is a great way to start all over or select another repo you rather deploy.
