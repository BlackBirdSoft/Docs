How to Backup Your Database
---------------------------

The GearHost Portal makes it easy to backup your databases



1. Click on 'Databases' from the left hand menu to see your existing databases

2. Click the diskette icon next to the database you want to back up
 
3. When the backup is complete, the portal will display a link you can click to download. A zip file will be downloaded which includes the date and UTC time.



>**Tip:** It's best to download the backup to your local storage right away since the link will expire in seven days. Make sure to always backup your databases and keep local copies on hand in case of emergency. We recommend making monthly backups.
