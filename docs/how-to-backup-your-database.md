# How To Backup Your Database
The GearHost Portal makes it easy to backup your databases

1. [Log in to your GearHost Account](https://my.gearhost.com/Account/Login)
2. Click on **Databases** from the left hand menu
3. Click `Backup Database` next to the database you want to backup
4. When the backup is complete, **click the link**
5. A **zip file** will be downloaded which includes the date and UTC time

>**Tip:** It's best to download the backup to your local storage right away since the link will expire in seven days. Make sure to always backup your databases and keep local copies on hand in case of emergency. We recommend making monthly backups.
