How to Use Two Factor Authentication
------------------------------------

The most practical way to strenghthen the security of your account on the GearHost Portal (in addition to strong passwords) is to utilize two factor authentication. The reason this authentication method is called two factor is because it requires something the user **knows** (their password), and something the user **has** (their cell phone).

In order to enable your phone to serve as the second factor, you will have to download and install the Google Authenticator application for you cell phone. Currently there are versions for Android, IOS, and BlackBerry.

2. This will bring up the authentication configuration screen
 


3. Select your country code, enter your cell phone number, and click 'Submit'
 
4. Your cell phone will receive a text message that contains a six-digit pin. Enter the pin and click 'Submit'

5. The portal will generate a unique QR code
  


6. Use the Google Authenticator app on your cell phone to scan the barcode

7. Once the scan is  valid, the application will provide you with a new six-digit pin. Enter that pin and click  'Submit.' Keep in mind that the pin is time specific and will cycle every 60 seconds

8. When all the steps have been completed successfully, your account will show a green icon signifying that your account is now secured

9. From this time forward, every time you log in into the GearHost portal with your user name and password, you will also have to provide the time sensitive, six-digit token that the Google Authenticator application generates
