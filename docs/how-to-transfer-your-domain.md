# How To Transfer Your Domain Name
In this guide we will show you how to transfer your domain name to GearHost. Please be sure to follow all these steps so your domain may successfully transfer.

## Transferring your domain
After everything checks out, we can now proceed with transferring the domain name; 

1.	Login to your hosting [portal](https://my.gearhost.com)

1.	Select the `Domains` menu on your left hand side

1.	Click the `Transfer` button on the top right and start filling out your information

1.	Select `Transfer Domain` to begin the transfer

1. Type in your domain name and fill out *Owner Information* field

#### Transfer Requirements
The very first thing to check is if your domain is eligible for transfer to GearHost. We will need the following procedures at your current registrar prior to starting the domain name transfer.

1.	**Update Your Name Servers:** Changing your name servers while your domain is being transferred may cause the transfer to fail. Be sure that you update your name servers before the transfer begins so that your domain will be working as soon as possible. If you have any concerns regarding this step please contact us and we'll be glad to answer anything

1.	**Disable WHOIS Privacy:** If WHOIS privacy is enabled, it will prevent your verification information from being retrieved and will prevent your transfer from succeeding

1.	**Update Your WHOIS Information:** Your WHOIS information may be used to verify your ownership of a domain before the transfer completes. Updating your contact information to ensure that you can access the email addresses on your WHOIS will prevent transfer failure

1.	**Confirm the Domain is 60 Days Old:** ICANN does not allow a domain to be transferred within its first 60 days

1.	**Unlock Your Domain:** Domain locks prevent unauthorized domain transfers. Be sure to unlock your domain just before transferring it so that it can be transferred successfully. The lock status of your domain can be viewed in your WHOIS information

1.	 **Check Your Domain's Expiration Date:** It can take up to 7 days to transfer a domain. If your domain expires during transfer it may become locked again, causing the transfer to fail

1.	**Check that the Domain is not in Redemption:** If you are transferring an expired domain, be sure that it is within 30 days of expiration. If it has been expired for longer than that your domain may not be transferred without renewal

1.	**Get Your EPP/Authorization Code:** You will need to get your authorization code from your current registrar in order to transfer your domain. Authorization codes expire, so you should ensure that you get it shortly before transferring your domain

#### Confirming the domain transfer
You'll receive an e-mail shortly requesting for you to confirm the transfer. The first link will provide information about our terms and conditions. The second link will ask for your agreement and request for the EPP/authorization code. Click on **Submit Request** at the bottom of the page and that's it! As an example this is what our confirmation page looks like:
