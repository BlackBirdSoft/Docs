**A) Purchasing a SSL through us.**

This would guarantee that your certificate is properly working and it's an automated process! You can follow our guide on how to do this [here.](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/order-ssl)

**B) Generate a CSR** 

Generating a CSR is required when you wish to purchase a SSL certificate somewhere else. You can view that guide [here.](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/create-a-csr)

**C) Upload Certificate using PFX**

A .PFX file includes both your certificate and private key, use this method to import your own certificate.

**D) Generate a certificate with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)**

Let's Encrypt is a popular tool used to secure websites. This is not recommended for e-commerce websites.
