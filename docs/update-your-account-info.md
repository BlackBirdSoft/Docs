#How to update your account information
We always recommend to keep your contact information up to date as much as possible. Fortunately, updating account information is a very simple process at GearHost.

 1. Login to your [control panel](https://my.gearhost.com) 

 2. Select the **Settings** menu on your left hand side
 
 3. In the `General` tab  you can update your e-mail, name, company name, mailing address, or phone number. Click on the blue text and a window will appear asking for your new information. 
 4. Select the check mark icon to save changes.

You can also enable [Two Factor Authentication](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/two-factor-authentication) to ensure maximum security for your GearHost account. Another benefit is the flexibility to invite other users to access your account through the [Teams feature](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/teams).

>**Tip:** When updating your e-mail address, your previous e-mail address will receive an e-mail asking for confirmation. This must be completed to save changes.
