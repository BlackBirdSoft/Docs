###Getting started with APIs

- Login to your [Portal.](my.gearhost.com)
- Select the **API** menu on the top left and create an API by clicking **Create API Key**. 

You will be provided a long API Key, which would be what our blue bar covers.

**Make sure this key remains private!** APIs are triggered by POST and GET requests. You can review more API documentation under [api.gearhost.com](http://docs.gearhost.apiary.io/#)
