# Enable Domain WHOIS Privacy

For domains purchased through GearHost you can now enable WHOIS privacy.

#  How does it work?
For those who don't know, it's possible to look up the registrant information for any domain name. When a person registers a domain name, their contact information is stored in something called the WHOIS database. You can then use a site like [whois.icann.org](http://whois.icann.org) to search this database for any domain name, which will tell you the details behind that domain like the person's email, phone number and even their home address.

When you enable WHOIS privacy for your domain name, we will swap out all of your personal information in the WHOIS database and instead present our own information. That means that the registrant's identity is protected.

#  Cost
The feature cost is $5 per domain per year. When enabled we will check to see how many years are left on your domain before expiration and multiply it by the cost per year. Once enabled you can enable/disable the feature without any further charges. If your domain renews in less than a year the service still charges one year.

#  How to enable
To enable WHOIS privacy on your domain:

1. [Log in](https://my.gearhost.com/Account/Login) to your GearHost account
2. Click Domains from the main menu on the left (only visible for those who have purchased domains through GearHost)
3. Click the domain you want to enable WHOIS privacy for
4. Toggle the WHOIS Privacy feature
