#Configuring a Default Document

The default document is the web page that is displayed at the root URL for a website. The first matching file in the list is used. Web apps might use modules that route based on URL, rather than serving static content, in which case there is no default document as such.


##What Is a Default Document?
A default document is used when you request a website from your browser. As an example, you may have a HTML website and the first file you want it to load is `homepage.html` instead of `index.html`. Updating the default document to `homepage.html` will make your website display the content of that file instead.
