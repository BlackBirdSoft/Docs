=========================

Restoring a database is easy with GearHost and can be done in just a few steps.

### To restore a Database from a backup:

2.  Click the Databases menu
3.  Click the Create Database button
4.  Enter in your desired database name
5.  Select the database Plan and type
6.  Click the Restore Database button
7.  Select your file (can be a native or .zip file)
8.  Wait for the database restore process to complete

### To restore a Database over an existing Database:

Before restoring a database over an existing database please make sure you have
a working copy of the database prior to moving forward as this process requires
you to first delete the database. To do this:

1.  [Log in to your GearHost Account](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login)
2.  Click the Databases menu
3.  Find your database and click the delete icon
4.  Then follow steps 3-8 above

>   NOTE: Since the restore process creates a new database your connection
>   strings will need to be updated with the new username, password and possibly
>   new server hostname.
