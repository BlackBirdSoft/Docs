#GearHost Nameservers

For TLD root domains to work on GearHost you must point your domain's name servers to the GearHost name servers. If you have purchased your domain through GearHost this already has been done for you. However, if you use a 3rd party domain registrar then you will need to make this change with them.

Each 3rd party domain registrar is different but in general you will modify your name servers under the DNS section of your domain with them.

The two name servers you must set are:

- ns1.gear.host
- ns2.gear.host

Changes can take a few hours to propagate however sometimes in rare cases you might have to wait up to 24 hours. You can confirm your name servers have been changed you can use [this site](https://www.whatsmydns.net/), enter your domain and set the record type to NS. Performing a search will return the name servers that some of the root servers around the world are set for your domain.
