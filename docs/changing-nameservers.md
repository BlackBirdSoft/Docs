#GearHost Nameservers

###Domains Registered with GearHost: 
If your domain name was registered through GearHost then you are in luck, and the Name Servers for your domain are already pointed to GearHost.  If you need to change where the domain is pointing please place a ticket in your support section of the portal.

###Domains Registered Elsewhere: 
If your domain name is registered elsewhere or your site has been hosted by another company, chances are that you will need to change the name servers for your domain to point to GearHost. The steps for changing name servers on a domain are different for every registrar. We have a list of the most common registrars below, if you're still having issues please [open a support ticket](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login).

The two name servers for your GearHost account are:

- ns1.gear.host
- ns2.gear.host

####How do I check my current DNS zone?
