#Getting started with MongoDB

###About Mongo
MongoDB is a [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) database that's scalable and optimized for big data applications. Companies such as Intuit, eBay, CitiGroup and Facebook are already using Mongo for some of their applications. While many developers have been eager to get started on Mongo, we've decided to launch this beta test so you can get started! Best of all, we're going to include **Free** and **Standard** database plans for this as well.



###Creating a MongoDB
1. Login to your [portal](https://my.gearhost.com)
1. Select the `Databases` menu on your left hand side 
1. Click on `Create Database` button on the top right
1. Select the Free or Paid plan for MongoDB

###Connecting to your MongoDB
1. Select the `Databases` menu on your left hand side
2. Click on your Mongo database
3. Retrieve your database login credentials


 >**Please note:** The port for the Free plan is `27001` and the Standard database port is `27002`.

###Recommended MongoDB clients
We recommend using [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/download/) and [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org/download) for GUI clients. Alternatively, you can use [Mongo Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/installation/) if you rather work through the command line.
