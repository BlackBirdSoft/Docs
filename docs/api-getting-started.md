#  Getting started with APIs

- Login to your [Portal.](my.gearhost.com)
- Select the **API** menu on the top left and create an API by clicking **Create API Key**. 

You will be provided a long API Key, which would be what our blue bar covers.

 Some API functions require both your **API Key** and **Cloud Site ID**. In this example, we're starting the application pool.
