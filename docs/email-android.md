# Setup Email on Android Phone or Tablet

This article will help setup your GearHost mailbox on your OS device such as an Android Phone or Tablet. If you are having issues with your email on your device we suggest removing the current account on your OS device and creating a new one using the steps below.

In the below example we will be adding the email account `john@ighdns.com`. You will use your email account and domain instead of the example account.

## Using IMAP

1. Confirm you are using the latest OS version using this [How to Update Your Android OS](http://www.ubergizmo.com/how-to/update-android-os/)
