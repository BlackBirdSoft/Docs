Add a credit card to your account
==================

Adding a credit card to your account will allow you to upgrade your service. This will give you more connections to your sites, allow you to increase space, and to add memory. Once your site has passed its development stage we recommend testing it on a Standard node, while still monitoring to make sure the site does not use too many resources.

####Updating Payment Details 

 Login to your [control panel](https://my.gearhost.com) and click on **Billing** found on the left hand side menu.

You'll find a quick view of your current bill for that month and in the upper right corner the **Payment Details** button. Click on this button and click **Update Credit Card** afterwards.


Fill in your credit card information. Make sure the billing address matches what you have registered with the credit card company. When you are done click on **Update**. Your billing information is now up to date and now you can scale your CloudSites and more!

**Tip:** We also accept annual payments, just open a support ticket and we'll charge your card and apply that as credit.
