# Add a credit card to your account

Adding a credit card to your account will allow you to upgrade your service. This will give you more connections to your sites, allow you to increase space, and to add memory. Once your site has passed its development stage, we recommend scaling it to a **Hobby** node to quadruple your resources!

### Updating Payment Details 

1. Login to your [control panel](https://my.gearhost.com) and click on **Billing** found on the left hand side menu
 
 
1.  On the upper right corner click on **Payment Details**
2.  Click on **Update Credit Card**  

1. Fill in your credit card information. Make sure the billing address matches what you have registered with the credit card company. When you are done click on **Update**. Now you can scale your CloudSite!


>**Tip:** We also accept annual payments, just open a support ticket and we'll charge your card and apply that as credit. We accept Bitcoin and PayPal payments too!
