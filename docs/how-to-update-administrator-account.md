# How To Update The Administrator Account For Email
When you enable e-mail hosting for your domain the very first user you create becomes the domain administrator. This account has privileges such as updating passwords, creating, deleting, or disabling e-mail accounts and more features! In this guide we will show you how to update the administrative account. 

1. [Log in to your GearHost Account](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login)
2. Select your CloudSite
3. Click on the **Email** tab
4. Select your domain
5. Scroll down until you see your e-mail accounts
6. Hover your cursor over gray person icon and click on it to set that as the new admin account

In this example `johndoe@myawesomedomain.com` is now listed as the administrator account
