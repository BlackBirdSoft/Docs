#How to open a support ticket

###Why?
There are various ways to contact GearHost however the preferred way of communication when you have an issue is through a support ticket. Yeah those pesky little things you write just to wait about a week to get an answer that doesn't make sense and only leaves you more frustrated. No, not exactly. At GearHost everyone, I mean, everyone monitors tickets.
