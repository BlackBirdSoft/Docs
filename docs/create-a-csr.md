#What is a CSR?

A Certificate Signing Request is a message sent from an applicant to a certificate authority (SSL vendor). After providing a CSR to your SSL vendor, they should provide you with an issued certificate file. We recommend ordering a certificate from us, it's a much faster and easier process. If you wish to proceed with ordering a certificate from us, click [here](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/order-ssl) to view those steps instead.
