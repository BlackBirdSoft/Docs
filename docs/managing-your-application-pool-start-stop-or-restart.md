# Managing Your Application Pool.
Sometimes your application pool can start to hang, or simply stops working causing your website to display a certain error. 

This guide will go over starting, stopping, or restarting your application pool.

[Log in to your GearHost Account](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login)

Select **CloudSites** and click on the one you wish to manage.

As an example, I'll be choosing the **austin** CloudSite by clicking on the blue text link.

This should take you to the **Overview** menu. Scroll down until you see the **Quick Glance** section at the bottom right.

From here you will be able to Start, Stop or Recycle your application pool.
