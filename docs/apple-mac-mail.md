# Configure Mail on Mac
If this is your first time opening **Apple Mail** and you have not already configured an email account, you should be presented with the Add New Account screen. If not, click on the **Mail** tab and then click on **Accounts.**

1. Select **Add Other Mail Account**
1. Add your name, e-mail account and password and click **Create**
1. Your host name should be `mail.yourdomain.com` , but replace `yourdomain.com` with your own domain name
1. Select IMAP or POP3 and put your e-mail account username and password. As a recommendation we think it's best to use IMAP. 
1. **Click Next**
1. Your SMTP server is `mail.yourdomain.com` as well
Put your e-mail username and password again
1. If you receive an *"identity of mail.yourdomain.com cannot be verified"* message, it can be ignored. Proceed anyway
1. Click **Connect** and your e-mail account should be set up
