#Configure Mail on Mac
If this is your first time opening **Apple Mail** and you have not already configured an email account, you should be presented with the Add New Account screen. If not, click on the **Mail** tab and then click on **Accounts.**

Select **Add Other Mail Account.**



Add your name, e-mail account and password and click **Create.**



----------

 Host Name: **mail.yourdomain.com**

Replace "yourdomain.com" with your domain name instead. 

----------

Select IMAP or POP3 and put your e-mail account username and password.

**Click Next.**



The SMTP server is **mail.yourdomain.com** as well.
Put your e-mail username and password again.

If you receive an *"identity of mail.yourdomain.com cannot be verified"* message, it can be ignored.

Click **Connect** and your e-mail account should be set up.



###Additional Tips
To edit your SMTP settings, select the **Menu** tab and click **Preferences**.


Select the e-mail account and you will see a **Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)** option.

Click on that and select **Edit SMTP Server List**


From here you can modify outgoing ports, connections types and more.
