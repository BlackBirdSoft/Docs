Create a new CloudSite
==================

If you are developing a new website or application you will probably want to separate it from your others. You can do this by creating a new CloudSite. CloudSites are like containers that hold your application. A CloudSite also provides the resources necessary to run your application such as CPU cycles, memory, disk space, etc. It's recommended that you create a CloudSite for each application you are developing.  

----------

##Add a new Cloudsite 

  1. Login to your [control panel.](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login)
 
  2. Click on the **Add Cloudsite** blue button at the top right.
 
  3. Enter a site name. The site name will create a temporary URL that you can use to immediately launch the application or website and preview before changing DNS. The control panel will automatically check to see if the site name is available or already taken.
 
  4. After choosing a site name you will need to choose a plan. Please be sure to click on the plan and ensure it's highlighted.
 
  5. After deciding on a plan you can choose to click on Create Empty CloudSite or Create CloudSite From Gallery. An empty CloudSite will simply build the resources you need without adding any files. If you already have an application choose empty CloudSite. If you would like to get started with a pre-built web application choose gallery and then choose the web app you wish to install. 
  6. After the CloudSite is built you will automatically be taken to the app within the control panel. From there you can configure your deployment credentials, download a publishing file, etc.

###What's the difference between hosting plans?
**Free:** The free plan is meant for developers. It is restricted in the amount of requests that can be made, memory use, and CPU use. This plan should not be used for any sort of production or public facing application or website. 

 **Standard:** This is our most common plan and it gives you 3-4 times more resources than a FREE plan. You are guaranteed a certain level of resources so your application cannot be impacted by others. 

 **Reserved:** This plan is unrestricted and gives you dedicated resources for your application or website. It has twice the RAM and 6 times more CPU than the Standard plan. It's recommended for applications who want UBER Performance!
