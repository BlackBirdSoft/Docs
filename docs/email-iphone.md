**Incoming & Outgoing server settings**

**Host Name**: mail.example.com  (replace "example.com" with your domain name.)

**User Name**: Your full email address

**Password**: Email password

A message stating "Cannot Verify Server Identity" will appear and this is fine as Apple by default uses an SSL. Although there is a SSL activated on the mail servers it will not work without special settings. Click on **Continue** to get past the errors twice and your account is now added!

**Tip:** We recommend setting up IMAP instead of POP3 as it's a safer way to save your e-mail in your devices and mail server.
