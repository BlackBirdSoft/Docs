- .cmd, .bat, .exe (using windows cmd)

5. Under WebJob Name provide a name for the WebJob (the name must start with a letter or a number and cannot contain any special characters other than "-" and "_")
6. In the Select file box, click the text area and browse to the zip file that contains your script (the zip file should contain your executable as well as any supporting files needed to run the program or script)
7. Select the interval you wish to run your WebJob; On Demand, Scheduled or Continuous
8. Click Create WebJob

> For Continuous WebJobs to run Always On must be enabled and thus the CloudSite must be on a Reserved web worker node.

###Notes
- Code for a continuous job needs to be written to run in an endless loop
- Reserved modes offer the Always On feature which, when enabled, prevents web apps from becoming idle
