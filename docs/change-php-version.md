# How To Change PHP Version

Changing a PHP version is required to get certain modules or plugins working for your application. Below we will show you how to change your PHP version for your CloudSite.


1. [Log in to your GearHost Account](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login)
2. Select your **CloudSite**
3. Click on the **Config** menu 
4. Select the **version** of PHP you wish to use
5. Scroll down and select **Save Configuration**

Your CloudSite will automatically recycle and load the new version of PHP. GearHost currently supports the following versions:

`PHP 5.3  = 5.3.28`

`PHP 5.4 = 5.4.30`

`PHP 5.5 = 5.5.14`

`PHP 7 = 7.0.7`

>**Tip:** Looking to configure your **php.ini**? We use **.user.ini** in our environment, and we have more detailed documentation on how to configure it found [here.](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/how-to-configure-user-ini)
