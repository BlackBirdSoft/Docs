##How to change PHP versions

Changing a PHP version is required to get certain modules or plugins working for your application. Below we will show you how to change your PHP version for your CloudSite.
***

1. Log in to your [hosting portal.](https://my.gearhost.com) Once logged in, click on **CloudSites** and then choose your CloudSite. 


2. Click on the **Config** menu and select the version of PHP you wish to use. GearHost currently supports PHP 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. 


 - PHP 5.3  = 5.3.28
 - PHP 5.4 = 5.4.30
 - PHP 5.5 = 5.5.14


3. After you select the version of PHP make sure to click **Save Configuration** at the bottom of the page. After the changes are saved the CloudSite will automatically recycle and load the new version of PHP.




>**Tip:** Looking to configure your **php.ini**? We use **.user.ini** in our environment, and we have more detailed documentation on how to configure it found [here.](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/how-to-configure-user-ini)
