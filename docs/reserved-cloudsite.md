# Small CloudSites

Your CloudSite blew up and your getting thousands of requests? That's great, we love that and we're here to help. Scaling out with reserved instances is incredibly simple and seamless. This is perfect if your blog post was just featured on TV or you need to prep your e-commerce site for the shopping season. It will provide the same experience for all visitors no matter how many are hitting the site because it provides great performance under load. 

### Scaling to a Small plan.
1. Login to your control [panel](https://my.gearhost.com) 
3. Now choose the CloudSite you want to upgrade
4. Select the **Scale** menu
5. Click on Small and then slide the scale below for how many instances you want then click on update plan. 
6. After the plan is updated your CloudSite will quickly recycle and then scale out to as many instances as you requested. 

### What are instances?
Our instances allow for sites that demand more resources to spread out their requests to multiple server clusters to allow them to function quicker. Each instance is a clustered cloud server that will serve your CloudSite's applications.

### Guaranteed results
In the real world this means a lot more performance when you have a lot of visitors at the same time. We benchmarked a wordpress blog by flooding it with 200 requests at the same time. By adding 10 instances we were able to go from 5.9 requests/second on a single instance all the way to over 60 requests/second over 10. Of course your mileage may vary depending on the type of application you're hosting.
