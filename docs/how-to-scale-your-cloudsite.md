# How To Scale Your CloudSites
If you are having issues with your CloudSite running slow or crashing often, it can be caused by your application needing more resources. We recommend increasing your resources to greatly improve performance. 

### What amount of resources should I add?
Unfortunately, we cannot predict this for you as each application is different. You can gradually increase resources over time, but we recommend overestimating resources and slowly decreasing resources to ensure the best up time possible.
