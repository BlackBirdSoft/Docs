Add a credit card to your account
==================

Unfortunately server hardware, bandwidth, and data center space aren't free so we can't give away the CloudSites platform. When you've reached the restrictions placed on the free account you'll need to update your billing details and one of those methods is adding a credit card. 

>Updating Payment Details 

 1. Login to your control panel and then click on Billing found on the left hand side menu.

 2. You'll find a quick view of your current bill for that month and in the upper right corner the payment details button. Click on this button.

 3. Now click on Update Credit Card in the upper right.
 
 4. Fill in your credit card information. Make sure the billing address matches what you have registered with the credit card company or bank. When you are done click on Update. 

 5. Your billing information is now up to date and you can scale to a larger plan and use more resources.
