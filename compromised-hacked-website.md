#My site was compromised
---
Are your receiving notifications that your site is being blocked because it is a phising scam or that malware was detected by your browser? It is likely that this is because your site was compromised.

##How was my site compromised?
The most common causes for a site compromise is a weak password. This could be a  password issue with an administrative login for your site such as in Wordpress. GearHost recommends the following password policies for any log in.

- 8 characters
- No words or combinations that are words (P@ssW0rD is still a bad password.) 
- Use characters (ie !@#$%)
- Use numbers
- Have upper and lowercase letters

Another way a site may have been compromised is through third-party content. Plugins, counters, and other content can have malicious content in it to hijack your site. Make sure to investigate each company that you download content from a reputable source.

Lastly, an attacker may have compromised your local machine. We recommend running a virus/malware scan on any machine you use to access your site.   
  
##How do I fix my site?
It may be possible for you to go in the code of the website and clean out the malware. We highly recommend deleting the site and reuploading your databases and site files.

Alternatively, there are companies that offer services for virus removal on websites.

##How can GearHost help?
 We do not offer any web development services at this time. Looking at code and cleaning your website is  beyond our scope of support. If you do not have a backup of your site we may be able to recover your site from our internal backups. Keep in mind that we may not have a working version of your site as our backups are for our internal use and only go back three days. Contact our support team by opening a ticket and we will be happy to look and see if your back up is available.
