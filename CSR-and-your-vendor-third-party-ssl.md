#Providing the CSR to your vendor.
In this step, this is where you provide your CSR code to your SSL vendor. Here would be the most common questions they ask for. 

**What type of server should I pick?**

It would be Microsoft IIS 7+.

**SHA-1 or SHA-2?** 

SHA-2.

**How do I authenticate?**

One common option is to create the e-mail account **admin@yourdomain.com**. They will send you an e-mail for you to approve of the request. The other alternative is they will have you upload a file in your root directory 
**(/wwwroot/)** for them to verify that you're indeed the domain owner. Pick whatever option is easier for you. If you have any issues with this step, it would be best to contact them directly. 

###I've done as requested and submitted my order, what now?

After they're done verifying the domain, they will eventually proceed with e-mailing your the certificate (SSL) after it's been issued. Once you receiving the SSL attachments, please proceed with the following [step.](http://example.com)
