##Sending e-mail from your website or application
GearHost doesn't offer SMTP support directly, So we recommend the following solutions if you are looking to send email from your application.  

For Sending Email you can use the following providers:

- [Mailgun](http://mailgun.net/)
- [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/)
- [AuthSMPT](http://www.authsmtp.com/)


In addition to the above products you can use a [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) or [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com) account for sending out emails, You can also connect to your own external SMTP server or relay.
