Sending Emails
=================
***


##Sending e-mail from your website or application
GearHost doesn't offer SMTP support directly. We recommend the following solutions if you are looking to send email from your application.

For sending email you can use the following providers, both of which offer free accounts.

- [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/)
- [Mailgun](http://mailgun.net/)


You can also connect to your own external SMTP server or relay.
