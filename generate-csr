In the "Cryptographic Service Provider Properties" window, select Mircrosoft RSA SChannel and 2048 bit length . Select Next.

Enter a filename for your CSR file. 

Remember the filename that you choose and the location to which you save it. You will need to open this file as a text file and copy the entire body of it (including the Begin and End Certificate Request tags) into the online order process when prompted.
