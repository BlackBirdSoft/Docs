#Teams
###What are teams?
Teams are a way to invite people to help work on your cloudsites but keep your billing information private. Once you have invited someone to your account this will give them access to the following

* Add/delete cloudsites
* Access publishing information for cloudsites
* Access your API
* Add/delete databases
* Add/delete email
* Upgrade any plan

They will not be able to access or change any of your billing details
