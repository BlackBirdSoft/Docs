 6. *Deployment Settings* can be edited by the user, keep in mind these are set to defaults and should only be changed by those who are familiar with the WordPress framework. If nothing needs changing, click the arrow to the right to continue.
 7. Enter your *Database Settings* on the next screen. These are the credentials for your WordPress database, that will allow your site to talk to your database.  You will need to remember these credentials for the future so keep them in a safe place or remember where they are stored in your WordPress files.
